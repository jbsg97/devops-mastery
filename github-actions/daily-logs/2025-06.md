# June 1st

## What I learned today:
* GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax
* Github actions has **five** core concepts:
    * **Workflows**: Its the general project or yaml file where Github Action executes.
    * **Events**: Its when it triggers, it can be on:
        * repositary events(push and pull-requests are more commun)
        * scheduled events(works on cron)
        * manual events(workflow_dispatch with is executed manually with optional inputs or repository_dispatch that can be triggered by REST API calls)
        * external events(workflow_call, makes workflow reusable and callable from other workflows or workflow_run, that can be triggered when a workflow ends, fails or is request.)
    * **Jobs**: Proceses that are going to be executed, example build stage, test, deploy, cleanup which can run in parallel or sequence.
    * **Steps**: Actual commands executed, like pip install - requirements, python script.py, etc.
    * **Actions**: Steps that are already created, we can call them to execute tasks, github has a market where there are a set for actions.
* Actions run on virtual machines called "runners", which are managed by github, but can also be configure to run on a self hosted server.

## What I practiced:

Created my first "Hello World" workflow
Made it trigger on push to main branch

## Tomorrow I want to:

Learn about different trigger types
Try adding multiple steps to a workflow
